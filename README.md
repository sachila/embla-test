# Online demo
[Demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-3combq?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts)

Please note that, for the online demo, i had to reorganise the file struture to support the stackblitz platform.
But the repository source contains the correct order.

## Development server

Please do a `npm install` once you have clone the repository and then
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
